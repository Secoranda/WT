# Laboratory No.1

In this laboratory work, I studied CSS, Boostrap 4.
## About implementation
I had some barriers regarding icon in input sections, like log in and sign in. There I inserted the icons directly in the placeholder, 
otherwise they weren't inside the box of input but above or below it. Other icons were imported from font awesome class.
I used also carousel slides, navbar and scrollspy. Did log in and sign up sections.
## About the idea/site
Name is EYE TRUCKING (design is lacking because of my skills).
The main purpose is to make easier dispatcher's work in a company. There will be possible to submit all trucks with following information 
(truck's info, driver's info, driver's dispatcher info, last load with pick up/ delivery time/date and broker's name and call back number). Each dispatcher will submit and manage his own trucks, but trucks status will be public for all company. So per day there will be available, covered, pending trucks.
There will be company section (all trucks) and my section (one dispatchers trucks) and a filter by search. After covering the truck 
dispatcher will have to fill in the new info, or possible another person (have to think about it...)
### Advantages:
1. Dispatcher will know what truck has to cover, when and from where;
2. At brokers calls will be easier to transfer to one of co-worker, in case appear some questions or a new possible load;
3. Saving time in working process, easier to create a stategy and to work in advancce;
4. Creates a link between dispatchers;

Per general that's the idea.
